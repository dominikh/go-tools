Poorly chosen name for variable of type time.Duration

time.Duration values represent an amount of time,
which is represented as a count of nanoseconds.
An expression like `5 * time.Microsecond` yields the value 5000.

It is therefore not appropriate
to suffix a variable of type time.Duration
with any time unit, such as Msec or Milli.
