Should use constants for HTTP error codes, not magic numbers

HTTP has a tremendous number of status codes.
While some of those are well known (200, 400, 404, 500),
most of them are not.
The net/http package provides constants
for all status codes that are part of the various specifications.
It is recommended to use these constants
instead of hard-coding magic numbers,
to vastly improve the readability of your code.
