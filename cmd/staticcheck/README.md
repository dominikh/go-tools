# staticcheck

_staticcheck_ is `go vet` on steroids, applying a ton of static analysis
checks you might be used to from tools like ReSharper for C#.

## Installation

Staticcheck requires Go 1.6 or later.

    go get honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck

## Usage

Invoke `staticcheck` with one or more filenames, a directory, or a package named
by its import path. Staticcheck uses the same
[import path syntax](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Import_path_syntax) as
the `go` command and therefore
also supports relative import paths like `./...`. Additionally the `...`
wildcard can be used as suffix on relative and absolute file paths to recurse
into them.

The output of this tool is a list of suggestions in Vim quickfix format,
which is accepted by lots of different editors.

## Purpose

The main purpose of staticcheck is editor integration, or workflow
integration in general. For example, by running staticcheck when
saving a file, one can quickly catch simple bugs without having to run
the whole test suite or the program itself.

The tool shouldn't report any errors unless there are legitimate
bugs - or very dubious constructs - in the code.

It is similar in nature to `go vet`, but has more checks that catch
bugs that would also be caught easily at runtime, to reduce the number
of edit, compile and debug cycles.

## Checks

The following things are currently checked by staticcheck:

| Check      | Description                                                                                                                                           |

## Ignoring checks

staticcheck allows disabling some or all checks for certain files. The
`-ignore` flag takes a whitespace-separated list of
`glob:check1,check2,...` pairs. `glob` is a glob pattern matching
files in packages, and `check1,check2,...` are checks named by their
IDs.

For example, to ignore assignment to nil maps in all test files in the
`os/exec` package, you would write `-ignore
"os/exec/*_test.go:SA5000"`

Additionally, the check IDs support globbing, too. Using a pattern
such as `os/exec/*.gen.go:*` would disable all checks in all
auto-generated files in the os/exec package.

Any whitespace can be used to separate rules, including newlines. This
allows for a setup like the following:

```
$ cat stdlib.ignore
sync/*_test.go:SA2001
testing/benchmark.go:SA3001
runtime/string_test.go:SA4007
runtime/proc_test.go:SA5004
runtime/lfstack_test.go:SA4010
runtime/append_test.go:SA4010
errors/errors_test.go:SA4000
reflect/all_test.go:SA4000

$ staticcheck -ignore "$(cat stdlib.ignore)" std
```
