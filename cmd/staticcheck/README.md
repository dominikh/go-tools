# staticcheck

_staticcheck_ is `go vet` on steroids, applying a ton of static analysis
checks you might be used to from tools like ReSharper for C#.

## Installation

Staticcheck requires Go 1.6 or later.

    go get honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck

## Usage

Invoke `staticcheck` with one or more filenames, a directory, or a package named
by its import path. Staticcheck uses the same
[import path syntax](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Import_path_syntax) as
the `go` command and therefore
also supports relative import paths like `./...`. Additionally the `...`
wildcard can be used as suffix on relative and absolute file paths to recurse
into them.

The output of this tool is a list of suggestions in Vim quickfix format,
which is accepted by lots of different editors.

## Purpose

The main purpose of staticcheck is editor integration, or workflow
integration in general. For example, by running staticcheck when
saving a file, one can quickly catch simple bugs without having to run
the whole test suite or the program itself.

The tool shouldn't report any errors unless there are legitimate
bugs - or very dubious constructs - in the code.

It is similar in nature to `go vet`, but has more checks that catch
bugs that would also be caught easily at runtime, to reduce the number
of edit, compile and debug cycles.

## Checks

The following things are currently checked by staticcheck:

### SA1005 – Invalid first argument to exec.Command
`os/exec` runs programs directly (using variants of the
[fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(system_call)) and
[exec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exec_(system_call)) system calls
on Unix systems). This shouldn't be confused with running a command in
a shell. The shell will allow for features such as input redirection,
pipes, and general scripting. The
shell is also responsible for splitting the user's input into a
program name and its arguments. For example, the equivalent to `ls /
/tmp` would be `exec.Command("ls", "/", "/tmp")`.

If you want to run a command in a shell, consider using something like
the following – but be aware that not all systems, particularly
Windows, will have a `/bin/sh` program:

```
exec.Command("/bin/sh", "-c", "ls | grep Awesome")
```

### SA1006 – Printf with dynamic first argument and no further arguments
Using `fmt.Printf` with a dynamic first argument can lead to
unexpected output. The first argument is a format string, where
certain character combinations have special meaning. If, for example,
a user were to enter a string such as `Interest rate: 5%` and you
printed it with `fmt.Printf(s)`, it would lead to the following
output: `Interest rate: 5%!(NOVERB)`.

Similarly, forming the first parameyer via string concatenation with
user input should be avoided for the same reason. When printing user
input, either use a variant of `fmt.Print`, or use the `%s` Printf
verb and pass the string as an argument.

### SA1021 – Using bytes.Equal to compare two net.IP
A `net.IP` stores an IPv4 or IPv6 address as a slice of bytes. The
length of the slice for an IPv4 address, however, can be either 4 or
16 bytes long, using different ways of representing IPv4 addresses. In
order to correctly compare two `net.IP`s, the `net.IP.Equal` method
should be used, as it takes both representations into account.

### SA1022 – Calling os.Exit in a function assigned to flag.Usage
The `flag` package has the notion of a `Usage` function, assigned to
`flag.Usage` or `flag.FlagSet.Usage`. The job of this function is to
print usage instructions for the program and it is called when invalid
flags were provided.

This function should not, however, terminate the program by calling
`os.Exit`. The `flag` package already has a mechanism for exiting on
incorrect flags, the `errorHandling` argument of `flag.NewFlagSet`.
Setting it to `flag.ExitOnError` instructs it to call `os.Exit(2)`.
There exist other values to react differently, which is why `Usage`
shouldn't call `os.Exit` on its own.

### SA5005 – The finalizer references the finalized object, preventing garbage collection
A finalizer is a function associated with an object that runs when the
garbage collector is ready to collect said object, that is when the
object is no longer referenced by anything.

If the finalizer references the object, however, it will always remain
as the final reference to that object, preventing the garbage
collector from collecting the object. The finalizer will never run,
and the object will never be collected, leading to a memory leak. That
is why the finalizer should instead use its first argument to operate
on the object. That way, the number of references can temporarily go
to zero before the object is being passed to the finalizer.

### SA5007 – Infinite recursive call
A function that calls itself recursively needs to have an exit
condition. Otherwise it will recurse forever, until the system runs
out of memory.

This issue can be caused by simple bugs such as forgetting adding an
exit condition. It can also happen "on purpose". Some languages have
[tail call optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call)
which makes certain infinite recursive calls safe to use. Go, however,
does not implement TCO, and as such a loop should be used instead.

### SA9000 – Storing non-pointer values in sync.Pool allocates memory
A `sync.Pool` is used to avoid unnecessary allocations and reduce the
amount of work the garbage collector has to do.

When passing a value that is larger than a single word (8 bytes on a
64 bit machine) to a function that accepts an interface, the value
needs to be placed on the heap, which means an additional allocation.
Slices are a common thing to put in `sync.Pool`s, and they're 3 words
large (length, capacity, and a pointer to an array). In order to avoid
the extra allocation, one should store a pointer to the slice instead.

See the
[comments on a Go CL](https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/24371/)
that discuss this problem.


## Ignoring checks

staticcheck allows disabling some or all checks for certain files. The
`-ignore` flag takes a whitespace-separated list of
`glob:check1,check2,...` pairs. `glob` is a glob pattern matching
files in packages, and `check1,check2,...` are checks named by their
IDs.

For example, to ignore assignment to nil maps in all test files in the
`os/exec` package, you would write `-ignore
"os/exec/*_test.go:SA5000"`

Additionally, the check IDs support globbing, too. Using a pattern
such as `os/exec/*.gen.go:*` would disable all checks in all
auto-generated files in the os/exec package.

Any whitespace can be used to separate rules, including newlines. This
allows for a setup like the following:

```
$ cat stdlib.ignore
sync/*_test.go:SA2001
testing/benchmark.go:SA3001
runtime/string_test.go:SA4007
runtime/proc_test.go:SA5004
runtime/lfstack_test.go:SA4010
runtime/append_test.go:SA4010
errors/errors_test.go:SA4000
reflect/all_test.go:SA4000

$ staticcheck -ignore "$(cat stdlib.ignore)" std
```
