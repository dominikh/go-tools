## Installation

Beginning with Go 1.17, the simplest way of installing Staticcheck is by running `go install honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@latest`.
This will install the latest version of Staticcheck to `$GOPATH/bin`. To find out where `$GOPATH` is, run `go env GOPATH`.
Instead of `@latest`, you can also use a specific version, such as `@2020.2.1`.

If you'd like to be notified of new releases, you can use [GitHub's Releases only watches](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/viewing-your-subscriptions#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository).

### Binary releases

We publish binary releases for the most common operating systems and CPU architectures.

## Running Staticcheck

The `staticcheck` command works much like `go build` or `go vet` do.
It supports all of the same package patterns.
For example, `staticcheck .` will check the current package, and `staticcheck ./...` will check all packages.
For more details on specifying packages to check, see `go help packages`.

Therefore, to start using Staticcheck, just run it on your code: `staticcheck ./...`.
It will print any issues it finds, or nothing at all if your code is squeaky clean.
